The other platform I mentioned is **Cloudinary**.

While you wait for the deployment, here is a quick breakdown of why I suggested them:

1. **Cloudinary:**
* **Best for:** Images and Videos.
* **Why it's great:** It doesn't just store images; it automatically resizes, crops, and optimizes them for you. For example, if a user uploads a huge 5MB photo, Cloudinary can automatically shrink it to a tiny 50KB thumbnail for your profile picture without you writing complex code.
* **Free Tier:** Very generous for small apps like yours.


2. **AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service):**
* **Best for:** Any type of file (PDFs, backups, logs, images).
* **Why it's great:** It is the industry standard. It is incredibly cheap and reliable, but it doesn't have the "auto-editing" features of Cloudinary. It just stores files exactly as they are.



**Why you will need one of these later:**
Right now, your app saves profile pictures to the Render server's hard drive. On the **Free Tier**, Render "wipes" that hard drive every time you deploy or if the server sleeps. Moving to Cloudinary or S3 solves that problem permanently.
