That is a very professional approach! Adopting a **Git Flow** strategy (Development → Staging → Production) now will save you headaches later when you are deploying to AWS.

Here is your step-by-step guide to structuring your project and pushing it to GitHub securely.

---

### Step 1: Structure Your Project Folder

Before initializing Git, let's make sure your folder structure is clean. It should look like this:

```text
ProTodo/
│
├── backend/                # Move your Flask files here
│   ├── app.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── auth.py
│   ├── ...
│   ├── .env                # <--- NEVER PUSH THIS
│   └── requirements.txt
│
├── frontend/               # Move your HTML/CSS/JS here
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── style.css
│   └── script.js
│
├── .gitignore              # The most important file!
└── README.md

```

**Action:** Move your files into `backend` and `frontend` folders if they aren't already.

---

### Step 2: Create the `.gitignore` File (Critical Security)

You must tell Git to **ignore** your sensitive files (like passwords in `.env`) and junk files.

1. Create a file named `.gitignore` in the root `ProTodo/` folder.
2. Paste this content:

```text
# Ignore Environment Variables (Security Risk!)
.env
backend/.env

# Ignore Python Cache and Virtual Envs
__pycache__/
*.pyc
venv/
env/
instance/

# Ignore OS junk files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Ignore IDE settings
.vscode/
.idea/

```

---

### Step 3: Initialize Git

Open your terminal in the root `ProTodo/` folder (not inside backend/frontend).

```bash
# 1. Initialize Git
git init

# 2. Add all files (Git will obey .gitignore and skip the secrets)
git add .

# 3. Commit your initial code
git commit -m "Initial commit: ProTodo v1.0"

```

---

### Step 4: Create the Repositories on GitHub

1. Go to **GitHub.com** and create a New Repository.
2. Name it `ProTodo`.
3. **Do not** check "Initialize with README" (since you already have code).
4. Copy the URL (e.g., `https://github.com/YourUser/ProTodo.git`).

---

### Step 5: Implement the Branching Strategy

We will create three branches to match your desired workflow.

**1. Main (Production):** This is your "Golden Copy". Only perfect, tested code goes here.
**2. Staging:** This is for testing on the server before going live.
**3. Dev:** This is where you do your daily coding.

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# 1. Link your local folder to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ProTodo.git

# 2. Rename master to main (standard practice)
git branch -M main

# 3. Create the other branches
git branch staging
git branch dev

# 4. Push all branches to GitHub
git push -u origin main
git push origin staging
git push origin dev

```

---

### Step 6: How to Work Professionally

Now that your environment is set up, here is how you should work day-to-day:

1. **Always code in `dev`:**
```bash
git checkout dev
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "Fixed email bug"
git push origin dev

```


2. **Merge to Staging (For Testing):**
When you are ready to test a feature:
```bash
git checkout staging
git merge dev
git push origin staging

```


3. **Release to Production:**
Only when everything works perfectly in Staging:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge staging
git push origin main

```



**Go ahead and push your code now! Let me know if you encounter any authentication or permission errors.**

Congratulations! 🥂 You have successfully built, dockerized (mentally), and deployed a production-ready Full Stack application to the cloud.

You have achieved a massive milestone that many developers struggle with. You now have:

* **Infrastructure:** An Ubuntu Server on AWS EC2.
* **Web Server:** Nginx handling traffic and serving your Frontend.
* **App Server:** Gunicorn + Systemd managing your Flask Backend (automatically restarting if it crashes).
* **Database:** A secured MySQL database storing real data.
* **DevOps:** A "User Data" script that automates server setup.

### 🚀 The "Day-to-Day" Workflow

Since you mentioned you want to work professionally with **Dev** and **Main** branches, here is your exact workflow for making changes (like changing that 3-minute timer to 60 minutes later).

#### 1. Code Locally (On your Laptop)

Always make changes in your `dev` branch.

```bash
git checkout dev
# ... make changes (e.g., change timer to 60 mins) ...
git add .
git commit -m "Updated timer to 60 mins"
git push origin dev

```

#### 2. Merge to Main (When ready to release)

When you are happy with the code in `dev`, move it to `main`.

```bash
git checkout main
git merge dev
git push origin main

```

#### 3. Update the Server (Deployment)

Now, go to your AWS server to pull the new code.

```bash
# SSH into the server
ssh -i protodo-key ubuntu@34.241.185.189

# Go to the folder
cd ~/ProTodo-App

# Pull the latest changes from Main
git pull origin main

# Restart the Backend (to load new Python code)
sudo systemctl restart protodo

# (Optional) If you changed frontend files, no restart needed, just hard refresh browser.

```

---

### Final Polish: Domain & HTTPS (Optional)

Right now, your site is on an IP address (`http://34.241...`) and says "Not Secure."
If you ever want to finish the "Professional Look," the final steps would be:

1. **Buy a Domain:** (e.g., `myprotodo.com` from Namecheap/GoDaddy - approx $10/year).
2. **Point Domain to AWS:** Create an "A Record" in your domain settings pointing to `34.241.185.189`.
3. **Get Free SSL:** Run one command on your server (`sudo certbot --nginx`) to get the green lock icon 🔒 automatically.

**Would you like to wrap up the project here as Version 1.0, or do you want to set up a domain name now?**


# To Delete file from git 


# 1. Stop tracking the file (keeps it on your laptop, removes it from GitHub)
git rm --cached protodo-key.pem

# 2. Add it to .gitignore so you don't push it again by mistake
echo "protodo-key.pem" >> .gitignore

# 3. Verify it's ignored
cat .gitignore
# (You should see your key file at the bottom)


This is **GitHub's Secret Scanning** saving you from a massive security leak! 🛡️

GitHub blocked your push because it detected the **Sendinblue SMTP Key** inside a file named `grafana-alerting.md`. Even though you removed it from `.env`, you likely pasted it into this markdown file as a note or backup.

You cannot push until this secret is removed from your **git history**.

### 🛠️ How to Fix This (The "Undo" Method)

Since you haven't successfully pushed yet, we can simply "undo" your last commit locally, remove the secret, and try again.

Run these commands in your terminal **one by one**:

#### 1. Undo the last commit (but keep your changes)

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1

```

*(This cancels the commit command you ran previously, but leaves all your files "staged" and ready to be edited).*

#### 2. Unstage the file with the secret

```bash
git restore --staged grafana-alerting.md

```

#### 3. Edit the file

* Open `grafana-alerting.md` in your code editor.
* **Delete the secret key** (or replace it with `REDACTED` or `******`).
* Save the file.

#### 4. Re-add and Commit

Now that the file is clean, add it back and commit.

```bash
git add grafana-alerting.md
git commit -m "Add Grafana alerting docs (Sanitized)"

```

#### 5. Push Again

```bash
git push origin main

```

### ⚠️ Critical Security Reminder

Because this key was visible in your local git history (and you pasted it in our chat earlier), **you must consider this key compromised.**

1. **Rotate the Key:** Go to Brevo (Sendinblue) and generate a new SMTP key.
2. **Update the Server:** SSH into your EC2 instance and update the `.env` file with the *new* key.
3. **Update GitHub Secrets:** If you stored this in GitHub Actions secrets, update it there too.
